# Abstract

As the technology develops the data generated is more and more and the traditional methods aren’t able to pick up the pace to keep up to the market. Finance industry is so developed that the techniques such as big data, Machine Learning and Data science are used in the industries to help with the data that was generated it the present time. In the finance sector, stock market and banking sector are some of the crucial parts, this paper will present the challenges of that the stock market and banking are facing and some solutions that are recomendations.

# Introduction

* From primitive times finance is always a very significant factor the human life. It is also used as an indicator in deciding the whether a person/organization/nation is successful or not. The finance sector also has gradually developed through the stages where the necessary analysis are can’t be done by humans. The technological advancements have revolutionized almost every filed in the world. In the financial sector, huge amounts of data are generated each day; therefore, more attention is being focused on turning that data into actionable knowledge. 

* Big data is generally referred as 3 V’s Velocity, Variety and Volume. In the present world there are different types of data generated such as images, videos, audio clips. These data are generated with a very high speed and more volumes of the data is generated than ever. Big data is generally used for uncategorized and unorganized data and since these data sets are very huge it will be difficult to analyze this data using regular methods. Big data and data science techniques have revolutionized the business world; this paper examines the application of these techniques to the financial and banking sector. *

# Findings: 

When we talk about financial sector the first thing that pops in the mind is stock predicting and Banking sector. Generally the stock price is calculated by different process and they are fundamental analysis, Technical Analysis and Quantitative Analysis.

## Fundamental analysis: 

Fundamental analysis is the process of assessing all components of a business or market in order to determine a security's fundamental worth. Intangible assets like as trademarks, patents, branding, and intellectual property are evaluated alongside tangible assets such as land, equipment, and buildings owned by a corporation [5]. In fundamental analysis this they have three aspects such as macroeconomic analysis, industry analysis and company analysis.

## Macroeconomic Analysis: 

Macroeconomic fundamentals research examines the underlying factors that move the industries in concern, and is often employed by long-term investors, although traders can utilize it to obtain a better knowledge of the markets they want to trade.

## Industry Analysis:

Fundamental analysis typically employs industry analysis. It has a variety of applications, including: Understanding the business and environment in which a corporation operates: Industry analysis is utilized in stock selection and valuation because it allows analysts to better comprehend the industry's health, the issuer's development potential, and business hazards.

## Company Analysis:

A review and investigation of a firm's financial health and prospects, management or marketing activities, and strengths and shortcomings are all part of a company analysis.

## Technical Analysis: 

Technical analysis is the practice of analyzing securities using statistics. Analysts and investors trace trends in securities movement using data on market activities such as past returns, stock prices, and trading volume [5]. Technical data is supposed to give insight into the possible activity of stocks or the market as a whole, whereas fundamental research aims to reveal the intrinsic worth of a security or specific market. Investors and analysts that employ technical analysis believe that patterns based on previous performance data can predict future performance.

## Quantitative Analysis: 

Quantitative analysis is frequently used to assess a company's or a large market's past performance. Investors use simple financial ratio calculations like earnings per share or more advanced calculations like discounted cash flow to do quantitative research [5].


In banking sector also the big data plays the significant role, banking isn't recognized for being a customer service sector that caters to individual needs. Bank culture is evolving as a result of the combination of service history and client profiles made available by big data analytics. Profiling may sound intrusive, but it's actually just an internet version of what bankers already do. Customers may now transfer money, deposit checks, and pay bills all from their mobile devices thanks to online banking. Human interaction, which was once employed to evaluate client behavior and come up with answers to problems, has gone digital.

Profiling allows banks to improve client happiness and retention. Big data analytics enables banks to get a more detailed image of each of its clients, rather than simply a broad overview. It keeps track of their online banking habits and tailors its services to their preferences; much like a friendly teller would with the same consumer at their local branch.

# Challenges: 

One of the challenge that banking sector is facing is low level data maturity, the more data there is, the more complex tools are needed to examine it, and studies have revealed that most banks and financial organizations do not rank themselves highly in terms of data maturity [2]. Data maturity enhances predictive analytics skills, which helps firms, plan more effectively.

Other measures evolve in lockstep with data maturity within a business. When a financial institution's data maturity improves, for example, the cost of business intelligence falls dramatically since there are fewer ad hoc requests or non-standardized reports. As a result, data gathering, utilization, and deployment become more standardized and scalable. Furthermore, improved data maturity enhances predictive analytics skills, which improves a company's capacity to prepare for the future. It also has a direct influence on a financial institution's capacity to give contextual and proactive customized advice to consumers. Personalized and proactive advice will be the key to an excellent customer experience in the future [5].

By low level of data maturity, it also effects the revenue of the company. In a world where everything moves very quickly having an actionable data is very advantageous.

In the stock market, the prediction of stock market is very unpredictable and another problem is novelty.  Because the future is fundamentally uncertain, forecasting the market is difficult. Rather than attempting to forecast when a reversal will occur, short-term traders are better served by waiting for confirmation that one is imminent. We confront new hurdles in gathering and processing data to extract information and analyze the influence on stock prices as more data becomes accessible. Live testing, automated trading, self-defeating, long-term projections, and sentiment research on business filings are among the obstacles.

In terms of live testing, the majority of stock analysis and prediction literature claims that the presented methodologies may be utilized to profit in the stock market in real time. It's a large claim to make since while an algorithm may do well in back testing in controlled circumstances, live testing presents a significant problem due to a variety of factors such as price fluctuations, unpredictably bad news, and so on.

# Recomendations :

Dell developed a simple data maturity model to measure their own data maturity as well as that of their clients. As you go up the data maturity scale, you'll notice that you're getting better at both gathering and using data. It also implies a foundation of high-quality data and a shift toward a culture in which data and analytics drive nearly all decisions and consumer interactions. Dell is using the big data to develop this model and this is might able to clear the obstacles of low level data maturity[8].

So many researchers are used big data to develop the model for the stock market prediction, one such type of the model is proposed, for example, used Big Data to suggest a more complicated model for predicting market values. First, a Dynamic Time Algorithm is used to extract the most comparable pattern to the current condition from a wide set of past data. Second, they suggest selecting the determinants affected by stock prices utilizing feature selection based on a Step-wise Regression Analysis. An artificial neural network model is then created to forecast stock prices. Finally, the model's overall accuracy is assessed using the Jaro–Winkler distance and the Symbolic Aggregate approximation (SAX) [6]. ). In another research, the author creates an internet of things investing platform and then uses big data and data mining techniques to extract useful information from previous data. To demonstrate that the prediction error of this technique is quite minimal, a simulation is run using historical data from a publicly traded corporation from 2012 to 2017 [7].



# Conclusion:

To summarize, we provide a quick introduction to Big Data in this review study. Then we look at how banks are using Big Data by looking at potential sources of Big Data and the primary areas where banks are using data. In general, Big Data is used in the banking sector to strengthen risk management frameworks and decrease financial risks. Furthermore, Big Data may be used to generate more precise marketing tactics, save transaction and operating costs, and improve customer service.

Financial markets provide a unique trading and investment environment, allowing trades to be conducted from any device with an Internet connection. People now have many routes to develop their investments thanks to the introduction of stock markets. Not only that, but it also spawned several types of funds such as mutual funds, hedge funds, and index funds, allowing individuals and institutions to invest according to their risk tolerance. Stock prediction will almost certainly benefit from hybrid systems that incorporate statistical and machine learning techniques.
