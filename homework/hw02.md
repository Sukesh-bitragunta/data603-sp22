# Introduction to NoSQL & Data Lakes

## NoSQL Database

*The limitations of RDBMS led to NoSQL databases. NoSQL databases generally aim for availability and consistency, They donâ€™t have a predefined schema and can store different semi structured and unstructured data. Some of NoSQL models are:*

* Key Value Database:
Everything is stored in key-value pairs, means every key has unique identifier to get the associated value. It is highly efficient, and scalable. 

* Columnar Database:
Everything is stored in columns and is not grouped as table. Each file is stored separately. Data is stored in record order, first entry in one column is related to the first entry in other. 

* Document Oriented Datbase: 
Document oriented databases are same as key value database, the difference is key value is treated as opaque and documents is stored in API or query.

* Graph Database:
Graph database is a subcategory of documents store model. The difference is they add a extra layer by highlighting the relationship between the documents.

## Data Lakes:
* It is central location where large amounts of data are stored in raw format. It is inexpensive and an easy open format. It is highly durable, low cost and easy to implement ML techniques. It centralizes, consolidate and catalog the data and democratize it.

* Data lake limitations are poor optimization, data quality and less support for transactions this can overcome by lake houses.

* A lake house uses same features of data warehouse but instead runs directly on cloud of data lake.
