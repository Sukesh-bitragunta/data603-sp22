# Big Data Challanges in Finance

## Introduction

* Big data is generally used to draw useful insights from the very large-scale data that is unable to solve using traditional methods. Big data came into light when Facebook showed how much information is gathered from its users. Big data doesn’t have a definite definition but is always considered as 3V’s they are, the volume, velocity, and variety. 
             
* Since digitalization, big firms and organizations have collected information about users, financial firms and banks have petabytes of structured and unstructured data that could use to create strategies that will be beneficial to companies. With these strategies, companies can perform risk analysis on tasks, stock market insights, and much more. But, the obstacles are also very high, they need to maintain the security of the data from the hackers and maintain the data quality, data is gathered from different resources, and need to maintain the data governance and data soils. 
             
* In this paper, I would focus on the problems that financial institutions are facing in the usage of big data and present solutions by using techniques that can overcome these obstacles.
